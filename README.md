# Overview

In this project I developed my knowledge in C++ by learning how to use vectors in my program

In this program,  I made a rainfall prediction program that will take what the user inputs and it will store it in a vector and will predict whether the harvest will survive or not

The purpose of this software was to further my knowledge of vectors and to master how to implement and pull information from vectors.

#Demo

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to do my code for this project

For this program I used a couple of different libraries such as Vector, String, iostream, sstream and iomanip in order for me to use vectors properly and in order to use specific vectors that store specific information

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- make a couple bug fixes with my code
- improve the randomness of my program to where it generates a random number each time
- Item 3
